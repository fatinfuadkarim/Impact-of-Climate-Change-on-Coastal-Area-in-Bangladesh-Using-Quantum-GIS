# Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Coastal-Area-in-Bangladesh-Using-Quantum-GIS
The constant climate change could be devastating to vulnerable coastal forests in a densely populated country like Bangladesh. Moreover, it's affecting the function and structure of coastal areas and their rich natural resources. The vast collection of RS datasets available with GEE (e.g., archived Landsat and Sentinel images) will be helpful to address global challenges such as climate change. Remote sensing (RS) and QGIS applications can monitor the earth's surface and atmosphere on different scales such as global, regional, and local. Collecting images over additional years can detect the risk to reduce risk on coastal regions, and It can also analyze the coastal environment changes. Using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin for QGIS, two Landsat images acquired over the study area have been classified. QGIS has facilitated processing big geo-data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods. Analyzing Landsat satellite imagery and aerial imagery, specific classification over large regions, and monitoring landscape over several decades can determine the change in the coastal areas.
